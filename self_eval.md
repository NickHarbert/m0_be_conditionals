# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
# When you need to know if something is true or false.
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
# I would have started earlier so I could've done more of the optional practice.  Made a calendar block to go back next week.
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
# Becoming more confident navigating between terminal and vs code, and getting more familiar with the git workflow.  
# I felt like I was actually progressing and retaining more of what I'm learning.
